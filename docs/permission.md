# >cask permission
Grant or revoke a user the permission to a use specific command.

## Usage
```
>cask permission <command> <grant/revoke> <role name>
```

No commands are available to users by default, since most commands would be catastrophic if anyone could use them.
To grant/revoke all commands to a role, use `>cask permission all <grant/revoke> <role name>`.
